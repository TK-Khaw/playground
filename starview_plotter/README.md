Take a photo of the night sky with mathematics!

Ever since the dawn of human civilization, night sky has been a part of different walk of life.
Its ironically meaningless existence, captivating logician and romantics alike.
Patterns only we see weaved countless tales and legends,
passed down from generations to generations,
bring forth courage in lone sailor navigating in a foreign sea,
inspired astronomers to find model best describe the world they see.

Truly the night sky is nothing short of fascinating. 
And of course from my cringe-worthy attempt at the poorly structured writing above you know that I'm no poet.

This project represents a naive attempt at rendering a view of the star sky
centered around a groups of celestial objects given their local 
horizontal coordinates. 

> Note that a more efficient way to perform the projection definitely exists,
such as simplifying the equations depicted in this document beforehand.
This project however serves just as an exercise for myself to
perform general-purpose non-realtime perspective rendering thus
efficiency is of least concern in this project.
