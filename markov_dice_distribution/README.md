# Markov Dice Distribution Computer.

This simple script utilizes Markov chain to describe the probability distribution of the sum of arbitarily faced dice roll.

## Usage
Simply provide number of dice rolled `no_dice_roll` and number of face each die has `no_die_face` to the script.

```bash
python markov.py <no_dice_roll> <no_die_face>
```

## Theory 
For the logic behind the script the equation can be found in [`markov.pdf`](/markov.pdf).
